To train your design sense, in this task you have to design a single screen - The home screen of an app to **keep an account of your transactions and help manage your finances wisely**! The screen need not be much complex, just needs to serve the basic purpose of showing current balance, recent transactions and other analytics.
> Cheat Sheet: You can take inspiration from (even cloneðŸ˜‰) any existing finance management app or look at examples of such apps from [behance.net](http://behance.net/) or [dribbble.com](http://dribbble.com/). Just make sure to include a little bit of your content too.

## Submission Guideline:

- Only design one screen i.e the home screen of the app
- It should fulfil all the basic functions expected from the home screen of such an app like account balance, recent transactions, should have an option to transfer and receive money, etc.
- Proper colour scheme should be used (primary & secondary colours) along with proper contrast and good choice of font style and weights.
- Focus on the principles of alignment, proximity and hierarchy along with making the screen look visually good.
- Submit the link to figma file in a .txt file and place it in the Design Muscle - 2 folder only

## Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)

Since 30 points are being awarded for a single screen, the alignment, margins, proximity, hierarchy and contrast must be utilised and implemented properly. No leniency will be provided in case any of these are missing or not properly utilised.

The visuals should look great. Search for proper colour scheme. The shadows should be great (Read the article provided on discord) and typography should be good.

Do get the screen reviewed regularly on discord, since multiple changes might be required.

Even though design is subjective and perspective based but the final decision of approval of the screen resides with the mentors and organisers. You can ask for help by pinging us on discord whenever required.
