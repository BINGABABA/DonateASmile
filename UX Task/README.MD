OPEN TO ALL. 

No need to claim this issue.
NO SUBMISSION WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER 21st December 11:59 PM.

This first task is based on basic understanding of User Experience and User flow. 

An app called DonateASmileðŸ˜Š is used to link charitable users and those in need. It will assist the donors in aiding and providing for underprivileged kids. The needy can ask for donationsðŸ’¸ and mention their requirements, and then they should be able to connect with the donors who can meet their requests.
For example, if an orphanage asks for 50 notebooksðŸ“š and a donor responds that he can donate 25, the orphanage will get those 25 notebooks and will have a remaining requirement of 25 notebooks.

> ðŸ’¡ The task needs to be done in FigJam. There is no need to download FigJam because it is free to use. It is quite simple to learn and only takes around 15 minutes. If you are not sure on how to use it, check the tutorial here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVNuArHH5WM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVNuArHH5WM)

## Procedure:

1. Think about how the flow of the app will be for an average user who has just installed this app and is opening this app for the first time. The user is assumed to be unclear with the functionalities of the app.
2. You have to decide how the user will move through the app, what steps will he need to take and in which order, for eg. the user first might need to sign up for the app, to choose whether they want to sign in as an individual or an organization, etc. 
3. You can also add how and on what basis the donor gets connected to the needy.
4. Finally create your ideal user flow in a FigJam file and provide its link (in .txt file). Submit your txt files in the 'UX TASK' folder only.

## MDC (Minimum Design Criteria)

The user flow can be very basic but it at least needs to fulfil the basic functionality of the app that is the end result should be that the needy gets connected to the donor and vice-versa. The flow should begin from user entering the app for first time. If the user is a donor then they should get connected to the needy and fulfil their donations and if the user is a recipient then they should find a donor who is ready to fulfil their donation.
