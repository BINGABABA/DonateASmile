## Hint

Use the noise plugin on figma to replicate this glass effect. You also have to apply multiple linear gradients on the rectangle.

Submit the link to figma file containing the screenshot as well as the recreated screen in a .txt file and place the file in ‘Glass Effect’ folder only.

## MDC (Minimum Design Criteria)

It should look very similar to the effect shown above. You can ping me on discord for any help.
