## Minimum Design Criteria

Since you have completed a lot of UI and UX tasks already, you must have gotten a fair idea of what comprises a good UI and what doesn't look good. Hence, not a lot of changes will be suggested for this last task. Being a 60 pointer you have to yourself decide what looks good enough to get merged and what doesn't. Final decision resides with mentors and organisers same as all the previous task.
