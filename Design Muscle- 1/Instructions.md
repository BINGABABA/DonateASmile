**OPEN TO ALL. NO NEED TO CLAIM. NO SUBMISSION WILL BE CONSIDERED AFTER 8TH JAN 11.59 PM**

Just like in any sport muscle memory is important so is the case with design. Over time to become a good designer you need to develop a muscle memory of good design practices which includes proper shadows, appropriate font sizes, an eye for proper contrast and proper spacing and alignment.

To train this design sense, in this task you have to design a single screen - The home screen of an app to **order food**! The screen need not be much complex, just needs to serve the basic purpose of searching, of viewing food items (preferably divided into categorical list) and probably a card view to show different types of cuisines or food items along with a short (5-10 word description) and of course a Order Now button. Also throw in the other icons that you think are required like cart, profile, settings, etc. 

Cheat Sheet: You can take inspiration from (even cloneðŸ˜‰) any existing food ordering app or look at examples of such apps from [behance.net](http://behance.net/) or [dribbble.com](http://dribbble.com/) (search for food ordering app). Just make sure to include a little bit of your content too.

## Submission Guideline:

- Only design one screen i.e the home screen of the app
- It should fulfil all the basic functions expected from the home screen of such an app like order now, short description and price, food items displayed in a categorical grid, view cart and settings, etc.
- Proper colour scheme should be used (primary & secondary colours) along with proper contrast and good choice of font style and weights
- Focus on the principles of alignment, proximity and hierarchy along with making the screen look visually good.
- Submit the link to figma file in a .txt file and place it in the Design Muscle - 1 folder only

## Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)

Since 30 points are being awarded for a single screen, the alignment, margins, proximity, hierarchy and contrast must be utilised and implemented properly. No leniency will be provided in case any of these are missing or not properly utilised.

The visuals should look great. Spend time searching for good imagery of the food items, use the plugin [remove.bg](http://remove.bg/) in Figma to remove backgrounds. Search for proper colour scheme. The shadows should be great (Read the article provided on discord) and typography should be good.

Do get the screen reviewed regularly on discord, since multiple changes might be required.

Even though design is subjective and perspective based but the final decision of approval of the screen resides with the mentors and organisers. You can ask for help by pinging us on discord whenever required.
