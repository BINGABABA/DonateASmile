## Submission Guideline:

- Design the home screen and the profile screen of the DonateASmile app.
- The content of the screens can vary as per your understanding of the purpose of the app.
- The screens must have proper consistency in terms of fonts, colours and imagery.
- Submit the link to the figma file in  a .txt file and place the file in ‘**UI Task-2’** folder only.

## Minimum Design Criteria

Since you have completed a lot of UI and UX tasks already, you must have gotten a fair idea of what comprises a good UI and what doesn't look good. Hence, not a lot of changes will be suggested for this last task. Being a 40 pointer you have to yourself decide what looks good enough to get merged and what doesn't. Final decision resides with mentors and organisers same as all the previous task.
