**OPEN TO ALL. NO NEED TO CLAIM. NO SUBMISSION WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER 29TH DECEMBER MIDNIGHT.**

You are already accustomed to Zomato's home screen. Does it require any changes, or is it flawless as is? In this task, design the Zomato home screen of your dreams. There is no need to alter the fonts, colours, or other visuals; simply try to rearrange them in a different sequence if you think it is better. What do you say? You believe it to be perfect as it is. The only thing to do is duplicate the screen exactly. If you have trouble finding the exact font, use ‘INTER’, and if you have trouble finding pictures, use Unsplash or Pixabay. For icons, you can use the iconify plugin on Figma or download it from [https://thenounproject.com/](https://thenounproject.com/).

## Submission Guideline

- Take Screenshot of Zomato home screen and place it on the figma file.
- Now take another frame of the same size (preferably 375 x 812) and try to recreate the screen exactly.
- Only the font used and the images can be different. For font, you can use ‘INTER’ and for images, you can download them from [https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/).
- Submit the link to figma file containing the screenshot as well as the recreated screen in a .txt file and place the file in ‘Short UI Task’ folder only.

## Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)

Recreate the screen precisely. Apart from text and image differences, there should not be a significant difference between the screenshots and the recreated screen.
