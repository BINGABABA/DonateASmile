The task is to write down your ideas on why the LinkedIn home page is designed the way it is and why everything is situated in the locations that it is. 

Also suggest changes in the layout or any other aspect of the homescreen which might lead to better user experience than it currently offers. 

Happy UXing contributors! ðŸ¥³

## Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)

Suggest at least two features of the homescreen and how they contribute to good user experience and how the experience would have been worse if these features would have been implemented differently. Also suggest at least two changes you would make in the homescreen.
  

> Features need not be very significant functions of the homescreen, they can be as simple as why the messaging icon is on the right or why the search icon is on the top or **anything which is similarly simple.**
