**OPEN TO ALL. No need to claim.
No submission will be accepted after 12pm 30th Dec.**

In the third rep, you have to replicate the **‘Inbox’ section of Gmail app.**

## **Submission Guideline:**

Take a screenshot of the **inbox section of gmail app** and place it in your Figma file and replicate it in a separate frame of size depending on your screenshot.

Only the images can be different, rest all needs to be pixel perfect and CREATED by hand i.e. all the icons, all the shapes, the text should be recreated. For images, you can use [https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/) and for icons you can use Iconify Plugin in figma or [https://thenounproject.com/](https://thenounproject.com/)

You can use the random written content, no need to type the exact content, but it should feel original.

Submit the link to Figma file containing the **screenshot and the recreated screen** in .txt file and place the folder in "Design Reps-3" Folder only.

## **Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)**

No changes will be suggested. Only single submission is allowed that will either be accepted or rejected depending on the accuracy of replication. Final decision resides with the mentors, no claim can be made on their decision.
