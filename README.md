# DonateASmile App Design 😊

Understanding the value of UI/UX in mobile apps is crucial for designing apps. Even if your app has excellent functionality, it could still fail if you don't pay attention to the designing aspect. The functionality and UI/UX of the app must be properly balanced in order for it to be successful. Are you capable of succeeding?

- Figma/Adobe XD
- Illustrator

## 🧾Common Rules:

- The repository is divided into several tasks. **Each task will be opened subsequently for a limited amount of time and all the submissions have to be made within those allotted days only.** NO submission will be accepted after the allotted time ends. The details for the specific tasks and the time allotted for each can be found in their specific folders.
- The mentors will evaluate the submissions and assign points for each specific task based on a variety of design-related factors, such as the use of design thinking, the authenticity of the idea, the submission's visual attractiveness, etc. The points will be distributed as follows:
    
    🥇1st Place :   Full Points
    
    🥈2nd Place :   0.8 * Full Points
    
    🥉3rd Place :   0.5 * Full Points
    

Since everyone should be awarded for their efforts, the rest of the participants who qualify for the **Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)** as mentioned in the respective folders of the task will be awarded 0.3 * Full Points🎉.

No claim can be made on the number of points awarded by the Mentors & Organisers🙂.
